# TTK4145-ElevatorProject

## Notes
* Might need to know which elevators is online. Not sure yet. If this becomes 
only a convenience, we will drop it
* Orders are divided into HW and SW orders. HW orders are orders from the 
physical elevator buttons. SW orders are commands to execute HW orders sent 
between elevators
* We might need error handler in every module.

## Modules

All modules are the exact same on every elevator.

### Order Interpreter

* Orders are divided into HW and SW orders. HW orders are orders from the 
physical elevator buttons. SW orders are commands to execute HW orders sent 
between elevators
* All orders will be sent to both a primary and backup
* If only one elevator on network, this elevator becomes primary and backup
* The backup will ensure that the order is handled, either by the primary or if
the primary fails it handles the order itself. 
* This can lead to two elevators handling the same order, but this is okay, as
we focus on no order losses rather than performance. 

#### HW Order RegistrationÂ 

##### Description
This module listens for hardware orders from the physical layer and decides 
who should execute these orders. From this, SW Orders are generated with master 
and backup details are broadcasted on the network.

##### Notes
* Lights should only be lit when the elevator knows it can execute the order. 
This is indicated by the HW order OK status

#### SW Order Registration
This module listens for SW orders sent on the network and gives message to Queue
 Manager to registrate them in to the correct local queue on the elevator 
 machine.

##### Notes
* 

#### Cost Calculation
This module listens for cost requests on the network. If it receives a request 
it calculates its cost and sends it back to the requestor. 

##### Notes
* How the cost function calculates this and what dependencies it needs must be
specified.
* It must request its own elevator's order queue and state
* Inside orders must have infinite cost if elevator id does not match elevator 
id in order.


### Queue manager

#### Notes

Abilities
* Add orders coming from order manager to queue
* Delete completed orders from hardware
* Check for expired backup orders and move these to primary queue if expired
* Save queue locally
* Load queue from local file
* Send message to order manager when primary order complete
* Receive message from order manager that backup order was completed on another
elevator
* Be able to calculate cost of an order

### Hardware manager

#### Notes
Abilities:
* Initialize hardware
* Listen for hardware orders 
* Receive control commands from FSM (go up, go down, stay)
* Send HW Orders to Order Manager
* Turn on or off lamps when receiving messages from order manager
* Tell FSM the state of the elevator (going up, going down, reached floor x)

### FSM/Control

#### Notes
Abilities:
* Intialize the elevator to a known state (e.g drive down to know floor etc.)
* Initialize the other managers and receive status from these
* Keep track of the elevator's state (going up, going down, etc.)
* Ask queue manager for first next objective
* Ask queue manager if we can stop for other orders
* Provide queue manager with the current state of the elevator

##### Startup note

FSM -> Hardware init -> elev init
Hardware send status ok to FSM
FSM -> queue init
Queue -> order init
Order -> Network module init
Network init send status ok to order
Order init send status ok to queue 
Queue init send status ok to FSM 

If status not ok, reset.

### Network manager
The purpose of the network manager is to make packet loss and other errors regarding the network such as connection drop/loss invisible to the Order Manager.

#### Initializer
  * Initializes the functionality of the network manager.
    * Trying to connect to network/localhost and requesting a soft system restart if this fails.
    * Starting the transmitter
    * Starting the Reciever

#### Transmitter
  * Transmitts all message types sent from order manager X times (to take package loss into account)
  * Before transmitting to the network driver, the message is signed with sender IP

#### Reciever
  * Recieves all message types sent over the network.
  * Triggers reinitialize of Network Manager (only) if the network reports any error with connecting/listening/sending
  * Checks that recieved message is not a duplicate of earlier messages to ensure only unique messages are forwarded to the order manager under normal circumstances.

#### Watchdog
  * Check for network changes (loss of network primarily)

#### Notes

Technical Implementation:
  * Topology: Mesh network (Broadcasting)
  * All messages are broadcasted via UDP
  * We will use the select approach and channels for all data passing
  * Core reliability must be handeled by Network manager, the underlaying driver does not handle this.
  * Messages on channels in the network manager are structs, they are serialized by the network driver (tested, working ok)

Guarantees about the elevator:
  * Other nodes do not care, the faulty node will try to reconnect and stay on 
localhost in meantime (will be invisible for order manager)


### Network driver
The network driver is not made by us. Source code and driver documentation found at https://github.com/TTK4145/Network-go.

#### Notes
The notes are a collection of important observations from studying the driver documentation, source code and testing it.
  *  Handles transmitting almost any custom data type and recieving them
     *  Can transmit and recieve several custom types on the same port also.
  *  Detects new peers and lost peers on the network automatically
  *  Function for finding own IP address (when connected to the internet)
  *  Does NOT handle packet loss at all.
     * If a "peer-packet" is lost, it shows up as if that peer has been disconnected.
     * Packages are not automatically resent, and no panic is caused by the packet loss. It will be up to the network module to handle the packet loss.
