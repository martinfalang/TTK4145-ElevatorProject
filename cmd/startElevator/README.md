# startElevator

## Introduction
The startElevator is a small standalone go-executable script that finds available local tcp ports for watchdog-elevator communication and elevator-driver communication and starts all the other applications needed to run the elevator service on the node. The only purpose of this application is to reduce the need for manual startup, and it is therefore not considered an essential part of the elevator system.
