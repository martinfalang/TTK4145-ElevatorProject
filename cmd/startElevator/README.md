# startElevator

## Overview
The startElevator is a small standalone go-executable script that finds 
available tcp localhost ports for communication between the elevator 
application and the watcchdog and for communication between between the 
elevator application and the elevator hardware interface application(currently 
configured to strat the driver simulator). Moreover, this application starts 
the watchdog application, the elevator hardware interface application 
(simulator currently) and elevator application to run the elevator service on 
the current node.

## Implementation
The ports for localhost tcp communication are found by trying to set up a tcp 
listener at a pre-configured base port and incrementing the port number every 
time that fails due to the port being busy. After two available ports are found, 
these are stored and the listeners that have been set up when searching for 
them are closed so that the ports will in fact be free when the Watchdog 
application and the elevator hardware interface applications want to use them. 

Information is passed from the `startElevator` application to the other 
applications by the use of flags.

When the three applications has been opened, the `startElevator` application 
terminates as it has no more relevant tasks to do.
